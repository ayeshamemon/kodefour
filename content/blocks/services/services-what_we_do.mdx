  <h2 fontSize="3xl|4xl">Umrah Preparations</h2>
  <p>
  Umrah holds a very special place in every Muslim’s heart. The importance of Umrah
  for every Muslim comes from its significance in Islam. Umrah is the pilgrimage performed
  any time of the year except during the time of the pilgrimage of Hajj. Umrah is also
  known as “the minor pilgrimage” as it not mandatory for every Muslim to perform,
  whereas, Hajj is also known as “the major pilgrimage” as it is obligatory for every
  Muslim to perform at least once in their life and it is one of the Five Pillars of
  Islam. To perform Umrah, you should be in a state of Ihram. Ihram is a state of purity.
  The word Ihram is also used to denote the garment worn by pilgrims when in the state
  of Ihram. Men garb themselves in a white, seamless, two-piece garment. The top garment
  covers the torso but, during Umrah and Hajj, not necessarily the right shoulder.
  The lower garment covers from waist to knee. Women wear long white robes which cover
  them from head to toe. All wear sandals, rather than shoes. To enter Ihram, pilgrims
  must wash themselves. A man may trim his hair and cut his nails. During Ihram, sexual
  activity, shaving, and cutting one’s nails or skin all are forbidden. There are also
  prohibitions against killing animals, except those that can harm people, fighting
  or quarreling, using perfumes, washing hair with shampoo, wearing gloves or socks,
  or uprooting oats or trees. Those who do these knowingly or unknowingly or by forgetting
  have to pay a penalty by sacrificing an animal or giving alms.</p>

  There are five places some distance from the Holy City of Makkah which pilgrims must not cross before they are in a state of Ihram if they intend to enter al Masjid al Haram for Umrah or Hajj. These points or stations are called Miqats. For map, see Location of Miqats
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li my="2">
  <b>Dhu’l-Hulayfah:</b> This miqat is about 9 kilometers from Madinah and about 450 kilometers from Makkah. Dhu’l-Hulayfah is the miqat for those who live in Madinah and for those who approach Makkah from that direction.
  </li>
  <li my="2">
  <b>Juhfah:</b> This miqat is about 190 kilometers to the northwest of Makkah. This is the miqat for the people who come from the direction of Syria.
  </li>
  <li my="2">
  <b>Qarn al-Manazil:</b> This miqat is a hilly place about 90 kilometers to the east of Makkah. This is the miqat for the people of Nejd or for those coming from that direction.
  </li>
  <li my="2">
  <b>Dhat Irq:</b> This miqat is about 85 kilometers towards the northeast side of Makkah. This is the miqat for the people of Iran, Iraq and for those coming from that direction.
  </li>
  <li my="2">
  <b>Yalamlam:</b> This miqat is a hilly area about 50 kilometers to the southeast of Makkah. This is the miqat for the people of Yemen and others coming from that direction. It is the miqat for many of the pilgrims from China, Japan, India, Pakistan who come by ship.
  </li>
  </ul>
  <p my="10">
  The area outside the Haram, the holy land on which the City of Makkah stands, is called al-Hill. Muslims who enter the Haram area on business or for other purposes need not do the ihram before entering the Holy City of Makkah unless they have the intention to perform Umrah or Hajj. Muslims coming to Makkah with the intention of performing Umrah or Hajj must not cross a Miqat without first entering into the state of Ihram, unless they live within the area between Miqat and the Haram. In this case they do Ihram either at home or just before entering the Haram area.
